**EtherWarp** is a Windows PowerSell Script that changes your IP Address.
**Version 1.1 is now Live** DHCP Support

---

## 🚀 Installation

### 📦 Download the .bat and .ps1 files

```bash
Make sure the .bat and .ps1 files are in the same directory. I recommend creating on your desktop folder named EtherWarp. To run the script, double click the .bat file.
The IP addresses in the script are place holders. You will need to edit the PowerShell Script for your desired IPs.
```

### 🌐 !!!Upcomming Updates!!!!

```bash
v1.1 will have the ability to return you back to DHCP
v1.2 Will have the ability to detect different adapters (such as Wi-Fi)
v2.0 Will have a Graphical User Interface
```
---

#### ⚠️ Limitations
```bash
To go back to DHCP, you will have to manually change it in the system settings
The current script only works with your ethernet adapter
Both of these limitations will be fixed with upcoming updates
```
